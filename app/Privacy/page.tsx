              1. Information We Collect
            </h2>
            <p>
              At Survex, transparency in the management of your information is a
              fundamental pillar of our relationship with the user. Below, we
              detail the nature, scope, and purposes of the data we may collect
              and process during your interaction with our platforms. To ensure
              the optimal provision of our services and the continuous
              improvement of the user experience, Survex may process the
              following categories of data: Registration and User Profile Data:
              Includes all identifying information—including, but not limited
              to, your full name, email address, postal address, and telephone
              contact number—provided voluntarily when formalizing your
              membership or completing forms within Survex Sites and Functions.
              Management of Promotions and Contests: All information provided
              within the framework of sweepstakes, contests, or promotional
              initiatives (collectively, “Promotions”) managed through our
              digital infrastructure. Participation in Loyalty Programs: Data
              derived from your enrollment and activity in our benefit schemes
              (collectively, “Reward Programs”). Authentication Credentials:
              Critical access information, such as usernames, unique
              identifiers, and security keys, necessary for the administration
              and protection of your account. Transaction History: Detailed
              records of purchases, commercial operations, or any economic
              transaction carried out by the user through Survex's digital
              ecosystems. Corporate Communications: Information contained in
              inquiries, incident reports, or suggestions that the user directs
              to our support channels, in order to resolve concerns and improve
              service quality. Market Research and Surveys: Data collected
              through research instruments that Survex—or allied third
              parties—implement for statistical analysis and market prospecting,
              always subject to your voluntary participation. It is important to
              highlight that the aforementioned information may constitute
              Personal Data. In compliance with international data protection
              regulations, Survex assumes rigorous confidentiality and security
              commitments. However, in cases where the information is not of a
              personal nature, or has been subjected to anonymization processes,
              Survex reserves the right of use and disclosure for legitimate
              purposes, with no further limitations than those established by
              current legislation. While browsing Survex Sites, advanced
              tracking technologies are employed, such as cookies, web beacons,
              and other similar mechanisms. These allow for the automated
              capture of technical data, including browser type, mobile device
              specifications, IP address, and the operating system used.

              permitted by law. At Survex, we work with partners who set
              specific requirements for their offers. We use your information
              (such as profiles and activity) to verify if you qualify for these
              opportunities. By attempting to participate in an offer, you
              authorize us to share the following with these third parties: Your

              Activity within the Offer: (e.g., responses provided in a specific
              survey). You act as the controller of this process: this
              disclosure occurs at your direction to enable your participation.
              If you wish to restrict this data sharing, you must refrain from
              participating in the offer or limit the information you provide.
              By participating, you explicitly instruct us to send this data and
              authorize the third party to link your activity with your
              qualification profile. Your privacy is our priority. We will
              request your permission before using your data for marketing
              purposes or sharing it with third parties (typically via a
              checkbox at the time of registration on Survex). Opt-out Option:
              If you wish to stop receiving communications, you may use the
              "unsubscribe" link provided in our emails. Exercise of Rights: You

            </h2>
            <p>
              Survex reserves the right to process and disclose aggregated,
              non-identifiable statistical metrics concerning its user base to
              illustrate the scope of its business model and Service performance
              to prospective partners, advertisers, strategic sponsors, and
              other reputable third parties, as well as for further legitimate
              legal purposes. These data sets are strictly anonymized and do not
              contain any personally identifiable information. Furthermore,
              Survex may grant access to your Personal Data to its affiliates,
              agents, or specialized contractors who assist in the operational
              delivery of Services through Survex Sites and Features. This
              network of service providers includes, but is not limited to,
              entities responsible for transaction processing, order fulfillment
              and referral visualization, communication and marketing
              management, data analytics, professional consultancy, IT support,
              cybersecurity, and cloud storage solutions. These third-party
              processors are contractually bound to utilize your Personal Data
              solely to the extent necessary to perform their specific functions
              on behalf of the company. In the event of a corporate
              reorganization, merger, acquisition, or the sale of all or a
              portion of company assets, the Personal Data held by Survex may be
              transferred to the reorganized entity or the acquiring third party
              as part of the business transition. Finally, Survex may disclose
              your Personal Information if mandated by law or if such action is
              deemed fundamentally necessary to prevent fraud or cybercrime, to
              uphold the integrity of Survex Sites and Features, or to safeguard
              the rights, property, and personal safety of the company, its

            </h2>
            <p>
              We place great importance on the security of all Personal Data
              associated with our users. We have security measures in place to
              attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of
              Personal Data under our control. For example, our security and
              privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as
              necessary. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse
              or alteration of information will never occur, we attempt to use
              all reasonable efforts to prevent it. You should bear in mind that
              submission of information over the internet is never entirely
              secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit
              via the Survex Sites and Features while it is in transit over the
              internet and any such submission is at your own risk. If you use a
              shared computer or a computer in a public place, it is advisable
              to close your browser when you finish your user session to help
              ensure others do not access your Personal Data.

              withdraw your consent, we rely on legitimate interests for the
              processing and there are no overriding legitimate interests to

              comply with a legal obligation or we have processed the
              information unlawfully. Please note that if you exercise this
              right, we may necessarily have to close your account and your
              participation in any of our Rewards Programs, as we would be
              unable to continue to offer you our Services. Restriction: You may
              request a restriction on the processing we undertake on your
              Personal Data. This right will only apply if you contest the

              of the data, the Personal Data has been unlawfully processed and
              you oppose erasure and request restriction instead, or we no

              to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. Objection: You may
              object to our processing of your Data if our processing is carried
              out based on our legitimate interests. Please note, however, that

              controller. Withdrawing consent: If the legal basis we rely on to
              process your Personal Data is consent you have the right to
              withdraw this consent. File a complaint: You can also file a
