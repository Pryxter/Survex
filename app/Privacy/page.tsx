            </h2>
            <p>
              At Survex, transparency in the management of your information is a
              fundamental pillar of our relationship with the user. Below, we
              detail the nature, scope, and purposes of the data we may collect
              and process during your interaction with our platforms. To ensure
              the optimal provision of our services and the continuous
              improvement of the user experience, Survex may process the
              following categories of data: Registration and User Profile Data:
              Includes all identifying information—including, but not limited
              to, your full name, email address, postal address, and telephone
              contact number—provided voluntarily when formalizing your
              membership or completing forms within Survex Sites and Functions.
              Management of Promotions and Contests: All information provided
              within the framework of sweepstakes, contests, or promotional
              initiatives (collectively, “Promotions”) managed through our
              digital infrastructure. Participation in Loyalty Programs: Data
              derived from your enrollment and activity in our benefit schemes
              (collectively, “Reward Programs”). Authentication Credentials:
              Critical access information, such as usernames, unique
              identifiers, and security keys, necessary for the administration
              and protection of your account. Transaction History: Detailed
              records of purchases, commercial operations, or any economic
              transaction carried out by the user through Survex&apos;s digital
              ecosystems. Corporate Communications: Information contained in
              inquiries, incident reports, or suggestions that the user directs
              to our support channels, in order to resolve concerns and improve
              service quality. Market Research and Surveys: Data collected
              through research instruments that Survex—or allied third
              parties—implement for statistical analysis and market prospecting,
              always subject to your voluntary participation. It is important to
              highlight that the aforementioned information may constitute
              Personal Data. In compliance with international data protection
              regulations, Survex assumes rigorous confidentiality and security
              commitments. However, in cases where the information is not of a
              personal nature, or has been subjected to anonymization processes,
              Survex reserves the right of use and disclosure for legitimate
              purposes, with no further limitations than those established by
              current legislation. While browsing Survex Sites, advanced
              tracking technologies are employed, such as cookies, web beacons,
              and other similar mechanisms. These allow for the automated
              capture of technical data, including browser type, mobile device
              specifications, IP address, and the operating system used. Fraud
              Prevention and Technical Monitoring: Survex automatically collects
              technical and behavioral data for fraud prevention purposes. This
              includes, but is not limited to, IP address history, device
              identifiers, browser fingerprinting data, geolocation signals,
              proxy/VPN detection data, and activity logs. This information is
              used to detect duplicate accounts, unauthorized access, automated
              activity, identity misrepresentation, or violations of our Terms
              of Use. Users acknowledge and agree that such monitoring is
              essential to protect the integrity of the platform and its reward
              programs. Such data may be used to create internal risk scores and
              fraud detection profiles to protect the integrity of Survex and
              its partners.

              2. How We Use Your Information
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you are a resident of the United States, we use your personal
              data and other information collected through Survex sites and
              features for the following primary purposes: Service Management:
              To provide the tools, features, and information you request
              through our platforms. Account Administration: To manage your user
              profile and ensure the proper functioning of your account with us.
              Auditing and Analytics: To monitor application downloads and
              analyze usage data to guarantee system integrity. Experience

              offer a personalized experience for every user. Identification and
              Security: To recognize visitors to our sites and maintain the
              overall security of the platform. Market Research: To conduct
              internal studies on our users&apos; demographics and behavioral
              patterns. Strategic Communications: To send you news, updates, or
              information of interest regarding our services and those of
              strategic partners (such as brands or researchers), provided you
              have not opted out of being contacted. Rewards Management: With
              your consent, to share data with third parties to facilitate your
              participation in incentive programs and receive information about
              your interactions with them. Third-Party Direct Marketing: To
              allow partner companies to send you relevant information about
              their products and services, subject to your prior authorization.
              Advertising and Promotion: To develop advertising campaigns and
              marketing actions tailored to your interests. General Business
              Purposes: Any other activity related to our business that is
              compatible with the original purposes of data collection and
              permitted by law. At Survex, we work with partners who set
              specific requirements for their offers. We use your information
              (such as profiles and activity) to verify if you qualify for these
              opportunities. By attempting to participate in an offer, you
              authorize us to share the following with these third parties: Your
              Qualification Data: (e.g., demographic profile information). Your
              Activity within the Offer: (e.g., responses provided in a specific
              survey). You act as the controller of this process: this
              disclosure occurs at your direction to enable your participation.
              If you wish to restrict this data sharing, you must refrain from
              participating in the offer or limit the information you provide.
              By participating, you explicitly instruct us to send this data and
              authorize the third party to link your activity with your
              qualification profile. Your privacy is our priority. We will
              request your permission before using your data for marketing
              purposes or sharing it with third parties (typically via a
              checkbox at the time of registration on Survex). Opt-out Option:
              If you wish to stop receiving communications, you may use the
              &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link provided in our emails. Exercise of
              Rights: You may revoke your consent or manage your preferences at
              any time by contacting our team through our support service. Fraud
              Detection and Account Integrity: We use collected information to
              detect, investigate, prevent, and take action against fraudulent
              activity, abuse of reward systems, false profile information, use
              of VPNs, proxies, emulators, or any technology intended to
              manipulate eligibility, geographic qualification, or survey
              outcomes. Survex reserves the right to withhold rewards, suspend
              accounts, or permanently terminate participation if suspicious or
              fraudulent activity is detected.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Survex reserves the right to process and disclose aggregated,
              non-identifiable statistical metrics concerning its user base to
              illustrate the scope of its business model and Service performance
              to prospective partners, advertisers, strategic sponsors, and
              other reputable third parties, as well as for further legitimate
              legal purposes. These data sets are strictly anonymized and do not
              contain any personally identifiable information. Survex may grant
              access to your Personal Data to its affiliates, agents, or

              service providers includes, but is not limited to, entities

              referral tracking, communication and marketing management, data
              analytics, professional consultancy, IT support, cybersecurity,
              fraud detection, identity verification, and cloud storage
              solutions. These third-party processors are contractually bound to
              utilize your Personal Data solely to the extent necessary to
              perform their specific functions on behalf of Survex and are
              required to maintain confidentiality and appropriate security
              measures. Fraud and Compliance Disclosure: Survex may share
              relevant user data with survey providers, offerwall partners,
              reward partners, fraud detection services, compliance monitoring
              vendors, and identity verification providers for the sole purpose
              of verifying eligibility, preventing fraud, enforcing platform
              integrity, detecting duplicate or suspicious accounts,
              investigating misuse of VPNs, proxies, emulators, automated
              scripts, or other circumvention technologies, resolving disputes
              related to incentives or rewards, and complying with legal or
              contractual obligations. Such disclosures are limited to what is
              reasonably necessary for these purposes. In the event of a
              corporate reorganization, merger, acquisition, restructuring, or
              the sale of all or a portion of Survex’s assets, Personal Data
              held by Survex may be transferred to the reorganized entity or
              acquiring third party as part of the business transition, subject
              to applicable data protection laws. Finally, Survex may disclose
              your Personal Information if required to do so by law, court
              order, regulatory authority, or governmental request, or if such
              action is reasonably necessary to: prevent fraud, abuse, or
              cybercrime; protect the integrity and security of Survex Sites and
              Features; enforce our Terms of Use or Reward Policies; respond to
              claims, disputes, or chargebacks; safeguard the rights, property,
              and personal safety of Survex, its users, partners, or any third
              party.

              We place great importance on the security of all Personal Data
              associated with our users. We have security measures in place to
              attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of
              Personal Data under our control. For example, our security and

              or alteration of information will never occur, we attempt to use
              all reasonable efforts to prevent it. You should bear in mind that
              submission of information over the internet is never entirely
              secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit
              via the Survex Sites and Features while it is in transit over the
              internet and any such submission is at your own risk. If you use a
              shared computer or a computer in a public place, it is advisable
              to close your browser when you finish your user session to help
              ensure others do not access your Personal Data.
