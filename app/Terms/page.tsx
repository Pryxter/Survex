              private info from other members. Support Abuse: Misusing support
              channels to file false reports, claiming rewards you are not
              entitled to, or communicating with customer service in a
              disrespectful or offensive manner. Fraudulent Evidence: Creating

              Performing offers in an artificial or "rigged" way that does not
              reflect organic human use. This includes using botnets, click
              farms, unauthorized AI/chatbots, or excessive searching to inflate
              Rewards. Exploiting Errors: Publicly reporting or exploiting any
              "Bug" or error that provides an unintended advantage or violates
              laws. If you find an error, you must notify our support team. If
              we determine, at our sole and absolute discretion, that you have
              violated these Terms, we may issue a warning before canceling or
              suspending your Account. However, you acknowledge that we are not
              required to provide a warning or notice before termination, which
              we may do at any time and for any reason. If your Account is
              canceled or suspended, you agree not to attempt to rejoin or
              create a new Account in any of our Rewards Programs without our
              prior written authorization.

              4. Rewards and Balance
            </h2>
            <p>
              In connection with your use of Survex, you may have the
              opportunity to accumulate rewards, incentives, and entries into
              sweepstakes. Incentives may be points or Panel Currency. This
              currency has no monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash; it
              cannot be auctioned, traded, bartered, or sold, and it is
              non-transferable upon death, as a gift, within the framework of
              domestic relations matters, or by any other means, except by
              operation of law. Information, official rules, and terms and
              conditions for rewards, incentives, and sweepstakes may be
              available in these Terms, on a Panel Website, at the beginning or
              end of a survey, in survey invitations, or on the website(s) or
              webpages designated for redeeming rewards, incentives, and prizes.
              The various types of incentives and rewards that Survex may offer
              are intended to encourage Panel participation and do not
              constitute compensation for time spent. Points or Panel Currency
              earned, or any reward redeemed for participating in Research or
              other Panel activities, are not calculated based on time spent.
              Likewise, any consideration paid or points earned for
              participation are not prorated hourly or in any other manner. All
              points in a Panel member's account expire one (1) year after
              deposit, unless they are forfeited or canceled earlier due to
              membership or account inactivity, or as otherwise set forth in
              these Terms. Panel member accounts are not actual bank or
              financial accounts and do not accrue interest of any kind. Points
              or Panel Currency posted in connection with the
              Applications/Services do not constitute the property of the Panel
              member, cannot be transferred during or after the member's
              lifetime (by operation of law or otherwise), and have no value
              until the member submits them for redemption in accordance with
              these Terms. If points, Panel Currency, or incentives are posted
              to an account by error, Survex may remove them. If they are
              obtained through fraudulent means, Survex will remove them, and
              the account may be suspended and/or terminated. Redemption Points
              or Panel Currency will be deducted from the member's account at
              the time the redemption request is made. All redemptions are
              final. Rewards may not be returned for credit unless otherwise
              provided in these Terms or agreed upon in writing by an authorized
              Survex representative. The minimum redemption threshold required
              to redeem a reward is the equivalent of twenty US dollars (USD
              20). Unless a lower redemption option exists, you cannot redeem
              rewards if you do not reach this limit. Survex reserves the right
              to offer reward options with lower minimum thresholds without
              prior notice or consent. Survex may modify, alter, delete, or add
              new terms to its rewards program or Applications/Services at any
              time and without prior notice. This includes changing point
              values, redemption levels, conversion rates, and membership
              conditions. Survex also reserves the right to terminate or cease
              offering any incentive or reward at any time. You may not combine
              your points or Panel Currency with those of any other member,
              including family or friends. Survex makes no representations or
              warranties, express or implied, regarding any product or service
              received through the program, including warranties of
              merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Survex is not
              liable for the performance or failure of any product or service
              redeemed, nor for any costs, damages, accidents, injuries, or
              losses arising from their use. Survex will not replace lost,
              stolen, or damaged rewards. Members should review their accounts
              to ensure points are correctly identified. If you believe there is
              an error, email Support@survex.app with your name, email, and
              specific details. Survex’s decision is final and binding.
              Third-party providers or websites involved in redemptions may have
              their own terms and conditions; please review them carefully. By
              accepting these Terms, you consent to the collection, processing,
              and disclosure of your personal information for the purposes of
              the rewards program, subject to the Survex Privacy Policy. Your
              daily redemption limit is restricted to two (2) redemptions per
              24-hour period.

              You acknowledge and agree that Survex is not affiliated with, nor

              disseminated, or generally promoted on the Survex Sites and

              Services. Furthermore, you agree that the Company shall not be
              liable for, nor have any obligation to offer any compensation with
              respect to, the cancellation of any Rewards Program or associated
              Account, including, but not limited to, unredeemed Rewards in your
              Account or existing in your favor at the time of cancellation. If

              future Reward, in the event of any change in the potential value

              computer system and/or network error or failure, criminal act, act
              of vandalism, cyberattack, or other events that make it not
              commercially reasonable for us to determine the amount of Rewards
              or the balance of any Account. To the maximum extent permitted by
              applicable law, all warranties, promises, and representations,
              whether express or implied, as to the condition, suitability,
              quality, fitness, or safety of any product and service provided

              or statutory warranties or representations that cannot be excluded
              shall be limited, to the extent permitted by law, to supplying or
              paying the cost of supplying the products or services (or
              equivalent products or services) or repairing or paying the cost
              of repairing the products or re-performing the services, at the
              Company's sole discretion. Please note that we may, at any time
              and at our sole and absolute discretion, terminate our legal
              agreement with you and deprive you of continued use of the Survex
              Sites and features and our Services and, without limiting the
              foregoing, we may do so if required by law (for example, where the
              provision of our services is or becomes illegal). The partner
              through whom we offered our Services has terminated their
              relationship with us or has ceased to offer their services to you,
              we no longer provide all or part of our Services to users in the
              jurisdiction in which you reside or from which you use our
              Services, or the provision of our Services to you, in our opinion,
              is no longer commercially viable.

              continued use of the Survex Sites and Features or our Services
              after receiving the administrative email or after the posting of
              the changes constitutes your acceptance of them. If you do not
              agree with the changes, please close your Account and discontinue
              your use of the Survex Sites and Features and our Services. To the
              extent an arbitrator (or a small claims court, if applicable)
              determines that applying any changes to these Terms to prior
              events or circumstances would render this agreement illusory or
              unenforceable, such changes will apply only prospectively, with
              respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of
              such changes, to the extent necessary to prevent these Terms from
              being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if you used
              any of the Survex Sites and Features or our Services pursuant to a
              prior version of these Terms that required a notice period prior
              to the effective date of any changes, the changes under these
              Terms will not take effect until such notice period has expired
              after the date of these Terms.
