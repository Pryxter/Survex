              AI/chatbots, or excessive searching to inflate Rewards. Exploiting
              Errors: Publicly reporting or exploiting any &quot;Bug&quot; or

              suspending your Account. However, you acknowledge that we are not
              required to provide a warning or notice before termination, which

              will be provided for forfeited rewards resulting from violations
              of these Terms.

              4. Rewards and Balance
            </h2>
            <p>
              In connection with your participation in Survex, you may have the
              opportunity to accumulate rewards, incentives, points, entries
              into sweepstakes, or other promotional benefits (collectively,
              “Rewards”). Rewards may be issued in the form of points or Panel
              Currency. Panel Currency and points have no cash value, are not
              legal tender, are non-transferable, and may not be sold, traded,
              auctioned, bartered, assigned, or gifted. Rewards do not
              constitute property, wages, salary, compensation, or any form of
              employment payment. Participation in Survex activities is
              voluntary and incentives are provided solely to encourage
              engagement. Points or Panel Currency are not calculated based on
              time spent and are not prorated hourly or otherwise. Survex makes
              no guarantee that any specific survey, offer, or activity will be
              available at any time. All points credited to a member’s account
              expire one (1) year after deposit unless forfeited earlier due to
              inactivity, account suspension, violation of these Terms, fraud
              investigation, or program termination. Accounts are not financial
              accounts and do not accrue interest. Rewards only acquire value
              upon successful redemption in accordance with these Terms. If
              points, Panel Currency, or Rewards are credited in error, Survex
              reserves the right to remove them without notice. If Rewards are
              obtained through fraudulent, deceptive, artificial, automated, or
              unauthorized means, Survex may remove such Rewards and suspend or
              permanently terminate the associated account. Fraud Review and
              Payment Holds Survex reserves the right to place temporary holds
              on rewards, withdrawals, or redemption requests for fraud review,
              identity verification, partner validation, compliance checks, or
              chargeback investigation. Processing times may vary depending on
              third-party partner confirmation procedures. Survex may delay,
              reverse, adjust, or cancel Rewards if: A partner reports invalid,
              duplicate, or fraudulent participation. Survey qualification
              criteria were manipulated. VPN, proxy, emulator, AI automation, or
              identity masking tools were detected. Chargebacks, disputes, or
              reversed transactions occur. Suspicious activity is identified
              during internal review. Survex is not responsible for delays
              caused by partner review processes. Redemption Terms Redemption
              requests will deduct the corresponding points at the time the
              request is submitted. All redemptions are final once processed and
              may not be reversed except at Survex’s sole discretion. The
              minimum redemption threshold is twenty US dollars (USD $20),
              unless a lower threshold option is offered at Survex’s discretion.
              Members may not combine, pool, or transfer Rewards between
              accounts, including family members or other individuals. Daily
              redemption is limited to two (2) redemptions per 24-hour period.
              Survex reserves the right to modify, suspend, restrict, or
              terminate any Reward program, redemption option, conversion rate,
              or eligibility requirement at any time without prior notice.
              Forfeiture of Rewards If an account is suspended, terminated, or
              found to be in violation of these Terms, all pending, unused, or
              unredeemed Rewards may be forfeited without compensation. In the
              event of account closure initiated by the user, any unredeemed
              Rewards may be forfeited. Survex’s decisions regarding reward
              eligibility, validation, and forfeiture are final and binding.
              Third-Party Rewards Disclaimer Certain Rewards may be fulfilled by
              third-party providers. Survex makes no representations or
              warranties regarding third-party products or services, including
              merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quality,
              availability, or delivery. Survex is not responsible for: Lost,
              stolen, delayed, or damaged rewards. Errors made by third-party
              reward providers. Taxes imposed by any authority. Technical
              failures affecting redemption. Members are responsible for
              reviewing any applicable third-party terms. Limitation on
              Liability for Rewards In no event shall Survex’s total liability
              relating to Rewards exceed the total amount of Rewards redeemed by
              you in the six (6) months preceding the claim. Chargeback
              Responsibility If Survex incurs losses, penalties, partner
              clawbacks, processing fees, or administrative costs resulting from
              a chargeback, payment dispute, reversed transaction, fraudulent
              activity, or violation of partner requirements attributable to
              your account, you agree that Survex may recover such amounts by
              deducting from your Rewards balance or pursuing recovery through
              lawful means.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Participation in Survex surveys, reward programs, or research
              activities does not create any employment, partnership, agency, or
              joint venture relationship between you and Survex. Rewards,
              points, or incentives are not wages, salary, or compensation for
              employment, and participation is entirely voluntary.

              These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
              the laws of the State of Illinois, United States, without regard
              to conflict of law principles. Any dispute, claim, or controversy
              arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of Survex
              Services shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration
              conducted in Illinois, except that either party may bring claims
              in small claims court if eligible. By agreeing to these Terms, you
              waive your right to participate in class actions or class-wide
              arbitration.

            </h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to modify these Terms from time to time, at
              our sole and absolute discretion. If we decide to modify them, we
              will notify you of such changes by means of an administrative
              email or by posting them on the Survex Sites and Features that we
              deem appropriate, so that our users are always aware of the terms
              of use of the Survex Sites and Features and our Services. Your
              continued use of the Survex Sites and Features or our Services
              after receiving the administrative email or after the posting of
              the changes constitutes your acceptance of them. If you do not
              agree with the changes, please close your Account and discontinue
              your use of the Survex Sites and Features and our Services. To the
              extent an arbitrator (or a small claims court, if applicable)
              determines that applying any changes to these Terms to prior
              events or circumstances would render this agreement illusory or
              unenforceable, such changes will apply only prospectively, with
              respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of
              such changes, to the extent necessary to prevent these Terms from
              being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if you used
              any of the Survex Sites and Features or our Services pursuant to a
              prior version of these Terms that required a notice period prior
              to the effective date of any changes, the changes under these
              Terms will not take effect until such notice period has expired
              after the date of these Terms.
